investigates criminal cases affecting
military personnel in The Big Easy, a
city known for its music, entertainment
and decadence. Leading the team is
Special Agent Dwayne &#39;King&#39; Pride, a
native of New Orleans who is driven by
his need to do what is right. Working
with him is Special Agent Christopher
LaSalle, who plays hard but works
harder; and Special Agent Meredith
&#39;Merri&#39; Brody, a charismatic and tough
interrogator who transferred from the
Great Lakes office in search of a fresh
start. Supporting them is coroner, Dr.
Loretta Wade, who is as eccentric as she
is smart. This colorful city that
harbors a dark side is a magnet for
service personnel on leave, and when
overindulgence is followed by trouble,
Pride&#39;s team is at its best.</dd>
