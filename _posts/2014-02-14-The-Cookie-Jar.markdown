##Disclaimer: This is not a real conspiracy.##

In the late 19th century, the first sewing machines were just becoming commercially available - in particular, in 1885, the Singer Manufacturing Company began producing the Singer Model 27/127, which utilized the "vibrating shuttle" technology (these machines are now highly regarded in the sewing community as the "Model T" of sewing machines.)

Naturally, this caused a major shift in the sewing community. Nobody was sewing by hand anymore. It was the beginning of a new era of sewing, one which combined man and machine.

Now, most of the sewing being done at the time (which still holds true today) was done by sweatshops. Tons and tons of sweatshops all over creation, paying barely any money to their workers as they slaved to sew clothing to be sold to the masses. Did these workers have enough food for anything? Hell no. They collected their nickels and dimes at the end of the day and took to the streets at night, begging for anything they could get. After all, they needed food, too. I mean, they could barely afford a loaf of bread, and that wouldn't satisfy their hunger. What would they be able to afford with such little money, that would keep them satisfied until their next payday?

Cookies.

That's right, cookies that come in those crummy little tins. So you've got a ton of sweatshop workers, being paid jack for sewing things together with their machines, constantly living in fear and poverty while they chow down on cookies like squirrels with acorns in order to keep themselves from fucking dying right then and there.

Eventually, after however many weeks of slaving over piecing clothes together and eating nothing but cookies, those tins pile up. It's not like they're going to get rid of the tins, they didn't really have much else and could at least use those tins for...I don't know, using the lids to play frisbee or something, give it to their kids as a toy?

So you've got these sweatshop workers, with STACKS of cookie tins, who are now using sewing machines. But what about hand-sewing? PFFFFFT, that's a thing of the past. Nobody does that in a sweatshop anymore! Why would they, when they've got these highly efficient machines?

But what about their hand-sewing needles? What about all of the things they USED to use? Going to waste. Just sitting there, next to their cookie tins, doing absolutely nothing.

Around this time, mobs were becoming more abundant in America and crime was flooding the streets, with criminals doing whatever they can to make a buck, finding gullible, vulnerable, impoverished folk to help them however they can.

And that's where the conspiracy happens.

There was a market out in the streets for hand-sewing needles and products - your every day citizen couldn't possibly afford a sewing machine. After all, they were expensive. But their wives LOVED sewing, and there was absolutely no competition for the manufacturers of hand-sewing products.

That's where the mob came in. My research suggests the Irish Mob was one of the first groups to utilize sweatshops as a means of racketeering and making a profit. Gangsters and mobsters would break into sweatshops and threaten their workers. Telling them they'll give them "protection" and "keep them fed and alive" if they give the mobsters the hand-sewing needles they don't use. Reluctantly, of course, the sweatshop workers would comply, in fear of having their kneecaps obliterated. 

And so, the business commenced. The mobsters, having no vessel in which to transport the hand-sewing needles to the black market, just grabbed all the cookie tins the sweatshop workers had left over. Hand-sewing products for dirt-cheap became a HUGE hit on the black market. Nobody went to a store to buy sewing products anymore - they just went out on the street and looked for a guy with a trenchcoat. For a FRACTION of what they were paying before, they could have it all - in the guise of a cookie tin. Genius. Cunning. Masterful.

It absolutely changed the world of hand-sewing forever.

Think of EVERY SINGLE SWEATSHOP IN THE COUNTRY being extorted for their needles. EVERY single one. There was a gargantuan amount of cookie tins with needles in them being transported across the sea and shipped to Europe, Asia, Italy, you name it. Soon, it was widespread all over the world. Not a single sewing company in America was able to compete with the mob's prices. And what did this all lead to?

There you have it. This isn't just a cute little coincidence. This isn't just something funny you happen upon one day browsing Reddit only to keep clicking around to find another funny post. No, this isn't just a one-time chuckle-worthy reddit post.

*This goes deeper than we thought.*
