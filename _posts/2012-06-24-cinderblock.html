<p>I always start personal projects from scratch. Well, almost from scratch. I made a super tiny boilerplate called Cinderblock that is the starting point for all my projects. I found myself constantly downloading <a href="http://www.getskeleton.com">Skeleton</a>, stripping out the grid, the favicons, extra JS and then getting started. After doing that 10 times, I created Cinderblock.</p>
<p>The whole project is:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>index.html</strong>: Base HTML5 page with links to the local CSS, a handful of meta tags, the HTML5 shim and jQuery from a CDN, and the local app.js file.
<li><strong>css</strong>: There are 2 files in here. Base.css has a basic reset and typography, while main.css is a blank document waiting for custom CSS.
<li><strong>js</strong>: Contains only app.js which is only an empty self-executing jQuery wrapper (a "document ready" basically).
<li><strong>img</strong>: An empty directory for future assets
</ul>
