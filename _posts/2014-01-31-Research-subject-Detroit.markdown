Great success until ~1929

Then Market Crash hit every major city pretty bad.  

**~1940** Federal government dollars begin to start ramping up for military production, workers (including a large number of Black workers from the south) flood into the city to pick up production.  

**~1950** Federal funds stop coming to Detroit, but auto industry picks up most of the slack. Right around this time is Detroit at its Zenith - was the 4th largest city in the nation and one of the nicest. 

**~1956** Thanks to pressure from the automotive manufacturers, the City of Detroit decommissions the remainder of its streetcar-based public transit system, the majority of the train service sold to Mexico City.
  
**1957** Last NFL Championship ever won by the Detroit Lions


**~1960s** Civil Rights movement hits Detroit really hard.  While segregation wasn't the issue it was in the south, you had a bigger divide because the laborers were overwhelmingly black while their management was overwhelmingly white.  In Detroit more than anywhere else, the labor component to the civil tensions were at the top.  

**23 July 1967** - Racial and Labor tensions come to a head, sparking the Detroit race riots.  At the time, remember, the police were overwhelmingly white, which didn't help the situation any.  These were worse than current Ukraine ugly, and eventually the National Guard was called in to put it down.  While white flight to the suburbs was already a thing, it accelerated dramatically after this.  Once again, those who did flee to the suburbs consisted of pretty much everyone with any serious wealth in the city of Detroit, thus reducing not only the total tax base but also the quality of the city's tax base.  To give an idea of the scale of this, the population of the Detroit Metro Area (City + suburbs) has been close to the same between 1950 and present day (4.5-5m) but the population of the city of itself has dwindled to under 700,000. 

**1970s-1990s** City has a spree of poor management, engaging heavily in populist politics driving a wedge between the suburbs and the city.  City slowly faces decline as businesses continue to move out while the City makes little effort at doing anything to draw people from the suburbs into town. 

**~1990s** Japanese automotive manufacturers catch up heavily in quality to US manufacturers with the introduction of advanced robotic-assisted assembly lines producing higher quality products that are more responsive to consumer demand.  US Manufacturers respond by riding a wave of low gas prices to push SUVs heavily onto US markets, making record profits

**~2000s** Rise in Gas Prices reduces the market impact of larger vehicles.  Japanese firms' advances in smaller vehicle markets and responsiveness to customer demand gives them a major edge. Detroit falls into deep economic recession starting in the early 2000s as the US auto firms become increasingly non-competitive.

**2002-2008** Kwame Kilpatrick takes over as mayor of Detroit, riding a wave of optimism as a rising star in the Michigan democratic party looking to revitalize the city.  Ends up overseeing some of the worst corruption in city history, wasting millions, and beginning a series of deficit spending that rolls into the current bankruptcy crisis.  Eventually indicted on corruption and other charges in a shitstorm that makes Rob Ford's drama in toronto seem like child's play. 

**2008** Mortgage crisis hits Detroit incredibly hard.  Home prices were already losing value with the auto industry struggles, and the subprime mortgage collapse sent home values (and by extension property taxes) through the floor.  Similarly, much of the lower income labor base, already suffering from weaknesses in the auto industry and related manufacturing sector, get hit hardest by the subprime mortgage rate hikes and resulting foreclosures. What little private value anything in the city at this stage has vanishes overnight, along with its tax value.  

**2008** Detroit Lions go 0-16. Insult: Meet Injury. 

**2008-2013** Mayor's office attempts to patch up the damage from the Mortgage crisis and the brutal ineptitude of the Kwame administration, but is stymied by the still-corrupt city council.  City politics are paralyzed, and the city drops deeper into debt.  Already ineffective Civil Services are increasingly cut as the budget crisis deepens.  

**14 March 2013** City of Detroit enters a state of financial emergency. Kevyn Orr is appointed as Emergency Financial Manager by Michigan Governor Rick Snyder.  

**18 July 2013** City of Detroit files for Chapter 9 Bankruptcy.
