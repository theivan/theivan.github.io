I&rsquo;m moving forward, not backwards. I&rsquo;m growing and I&rsquo;m sort of happy to be 30.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I&rsquo;ve struggled immensely throughout the last two maybe even three years, as a decade faded for me. And through the struggle, I grew tremendously. I am a different man. We change over time - we really do - often for the better.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I am a better man today than I was yesterday. But I am far from perfect. I make mistakes and bad decisions, and I fail at times. I stumble, fall. I am human - a mixed bag, nuanced, simple and complicated - as are you. And you are extraordinary.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">My story is unique, and yet it is no different than yours, minus the details.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I have loved. I have laughed, grown, and contributed. And for that I am grateful.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I have hated. I have hurt, damaged, and lied. And for that I am sorry.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I have lived. And for that I bear no regrets.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But soon a new decade begins for me, a decade of </span><span class="c0">opportunity</span><span class="c0">. My twenties were filled with the greatest joys of my life, as well as my most excruciating pains. I can see it lingering behind me in the foreground of my rearview mirror. Perhaps my thirties will bring forth a certain kind of levity, a certain kind of serenity, a certain kind of calm.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Or perhaps life isn&rsquo;t meant to contain these kinds of absolutes. Perhaps one must sit in the valley of shadows to see the beauty of the mountaintop, to appreciate his ascent, to live a meaningful life. And perhaps the key is to not </span><span class="c0">live </span><span class="c0">in the valley or in the shadows, but, rather, to be aware of why you are there and prepare for the journey ahead.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Not too long ago </span><span class="c0">Mark Robertson</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;wrote a line that stuck with me. He said, &ldquo;Sometimes rock bottom is the finest place to be.&rdquo;&#157; For me, his sentiment speaks of opportunity, of growth, of a bright and compelling future, irrespective of your current situation, be it good, bad, or somewhere in between.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Whatever the case may be, I will embrace this life, even though it frightens </span><span class="c0">me deeply</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;at times. It is the only life I have. And I will love my life - a beautiful and terrifying and wondrous life - through the good times and the bad.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Here&rsquo;s to another 30 years, and then another.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ivan</span></p><p class="c3"><span></span></p></body></html>
