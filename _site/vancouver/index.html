            <p>I want to work in Vancouver.If the internet were a machine, what would it sound like?
Would it be the gentle mechanical hum of a well engineered car? Or the 60 Hz drone of an electric light bulb? Perhaps it would run whisper quiet, a testament to the brilliance of its engineering.</p>

<p>I believe it would sound a lot like the cacophony of a busy coffeehouse, where caffeine-fueled ideas, ambition, and conversation mix to form a soundtrack of ingenuity. This was the soundtrack that inspired some of humanity’s greatest thinkers: Isaac Newton, John Locke, David Hume, Adam Smith, and more. The products of this great “primordial ooze” of conversation-fueled ideation redefined how I understand the world and ushered the modern era of science, business, philosophy, politics, and news.</p>

<p>The internet is today’s Enlightenment-era coffeehouse, where the greatest minds of our time gather to debate the mysteries and controversies of our day. I’ve been trying to push the boundaries of the internet for almost 10 years: developing platforms, exploring and defining the dynamics of the social web, and explaining what it means to think digital and be digital. The focus has always been delivering against a great strategy… one that begins with the consumer, delivers against client objectives, and provides a highly usable and enjoyable user experience.</p>

<p>But after 10 years, I thought it was time I joined the conversation, to share some of these ideas and spark some candid discussions. Because the internet doesn’t run on graphics, web pages, .net frameworks, or rich media banner ads. The internet runs on the power of human beings connecting, sharing, debating and interacting with each other.</p>

<p>So why don’t you pull up a chair - share your ideas.</p>
