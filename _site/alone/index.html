            There will always be a constant.

I can't even remember when it all began. I don't remember when I was born and I don't recall if I had a name. Sometimes I make up a name for myself but I always forget it again. Of course, a name isn't needed when there is no one else in the universe, but it's nice to have something to call myself. A designation for the collection of atoms that is me. I've decided to call myself "John" today.

Hello. I know you can't really hear me, I know that you're just a figment of my imagination but it's nice to pretend to talk to someone. I've decided that your name is Barbara. I don't know if my words even make sense. Chances are that I've forgotten language too but that hardly matters. I can't talk in space anyway so I'm just thinking really hard and pretending that you're here to listen.

Hello, Barbara. My name is John. It's nice to meet you.

The universe is dark now. Matter spread out over time. Planets slowly dissolved into nothing, the stars went supernova and exploded in a fury of heat and colors. The universe is still here, I suppose, but it's not really much use in this state. There are no suns, no planets or asteroids hurtling through it, none of what made it so glorious before.

You should have seen it, Barbara. It was amazing. Each planet had its own, glorious scenery. Some were colored in ice that perfectly reflected the starlight and some had weather patterns so insane that each day was a glorious, thunderous lightshow. And life! Life was my favorite thing of all. Self-contained replicating systems that interacted and communicated much like we are now. They were perfect. I loved life, I really did. Of course, it had its ups and downs but of all the things the universe had, life was by far my favorite.

Say, Barbara, do you want to hear a secret? I can die. I'm immortal now but if I ever made the conscious decision to die then I would and my particles would dissolve just like the rest of the universe. However, I can't allow myself to do so. I'm not even tempted any longer because I know that I have the most important role of all: There will always be a constant and I'm it.

I have mass. Not a lot, but I have some. Right now, entropy has spread particles perfectly over the universe but I have mass and with it just a tiny bit of gravitational pull. Over the next trillions of years, the particles will slowly move towards me. A small layer of dust at first then slowly more and more until every bit of matter in the whole universe is here at this very spot in a singularity more powerful than anything else the world has ever seen.

It'll hurt, of course. It always hurts. The vacuum of space, the fiery core of the singularity, every part of it makes my body convulse with intense pain, but it's worth it. The singularity won't be stable. It'll eventually collapse on itself and the particles will once again be unleashed into the dawn of a glorious new universe.

It has happened so many times. So very, very many times, Barbara. There must always be a constant because the constant ensures that the new universe will be born. There will be life again someday. Oh, there'll be so much life; whole planets will be covered by it. We may never meet for real, Barbara, but I feel happy knowing that you might one day exist outside of my mind. Sure, your universe will die one day just like all the previous ones but you know what? While it remains, it'll be a glorious splendor of life and it'll make all these dark days worth it. 

Thank you, Barbara. Really. Thank you.
