            A great source here is Naomi Klein's *No Logo.*

Her point, which was one of those things that's obvious once it's pointed out, is that we buy images as much as products. 

Look at it this way:

It's been shown that if you add a picture of a sprig of parsley to a can of meat, [people report that the meat tastes better.](http://books.google.com/books?id=VKGbb1hg8JAC&pg=PT96&lpg=PT96&dq=%22that+little+bit+of+parsley+helps%22&source=bl&ots=XrWj520m0V&sig=wFhN-gAddlk8NS3ljnJeg8jb3EY&hl=en&sa=X&ei=rnqTUtL5HdSwsASPioGAAw&ved=0CCkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22that%20little%20bit%20of%20parsley%20helps%22&f=false)

Similarly, put a high price tag on a bottle of wine, and [people will prefer that wine](http://www.wine-searcher.com/m/2012/10/expensive-wines-taste-better-study) to the same wine in a generic bottle.

And if people report that it tastes better, we can't really argue with that. They're not deluded--if they say it tastes better, it tastes better.

So, part of the value of the can of meat comes from the meat itself, and part comes from the picture of parsley.

Part of the value of the wine comes from the wine itself--you can't just sell vinegar for $200 and expect people to not notice--and some comes from the price tag.

In other words, the *image* is part of what we're buying. 

Klein's point is that image is often a *large* part of what we're buying. So it actually makes perfect sense that, back in the 1990s, Michael Jordan was paid more to lend his image to Air Jordans than the entire Vietnamese workforce was paid to make them--buyers were getting value from the image as well as the shoe.

And again, people aren't deluded--if owning Air Jordans gets you respect on the playground, then you're *right* to buy them for the image.

So advertising (unlike what many econ texts will still tell you) doesn't remind you that you can get a Coke if you're thirsty. At least, it doesn't only do that. It also conveys and reinforces an image, and to some degree the image is what you're buying.

And keeping an image in people's mind takes a lot more work than just reminding us that a product exists. After all, what does [a bunch of people singing with candles](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ib-Qiyklq-Q) actually have to do with the experience of drinking caffeinated sugar water? 

If you *don't* keep the image in people's mind, bad things happen to your brand. We can see this with the new Australian law that cigarettes have to be sold in plain packaging (i.e., no branding). Sales have dropped, even though anyone who could buy a cig before the law can still do so. "Most of this industry is about image. It's not about tobacco," [in the words of a law professor.](http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/australias-plain-packaging-stubs-out-cigarette-branding-prompting-backlash/2013/10/29/317e58cc-3ccd-11e3-a94f-b58017bfee6c_story.html)

That sounds weird, and the Coca-cola company itself blundered badly in the 1980s by not realizing it. They knew that people preferred Pepsi in blind taste tests, and they [changed the formula](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Coke). But people didn't just buy the taste, they bought the image--the familiar old can with the awesome lettering, the sense of tradition, the people singing with candles. There was a big outcry--far louder and more outraged than when, say, politicians take our votes away--and Coke changed the formula back. More important, they changed the *can* back (more or less). In my opinion, if they'd simply gradually changed the formula and not told anyone, nobody would have noticed (the American beer companies turned their beer to dishwater in the 1950s and 1960s and nobody said boo).
