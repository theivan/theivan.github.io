            Hi there! I'm new to Reddit and new to posting, but I loved this sub-reddit so much I had to make an account. Anyway, on to your question! 

I'm currently also applying for a new job as well. When I first started applying, I felt really good about it and I was super efficient. "Oh shit! That McKinsey guy I met agreed to forward my application to the right people! Wait, what? Google is in the middle of a hiring expansion? Yes!" 

The problem? Simple, you're not going to get all of these jobs. You're just not. And here's the deal, it's tough. You have zero reward coming your way for doing a lot of work, or at the least, zero reward coming in immediately. You say that you are a reasonably disciplined person, and I believe you. Think about all those things you are disciplined about, whether it is getting your work done, getting that crucial workout in or making sure you sleep on time. It all has a reward that's fairly immediate.

The trick, for me, to applying to jobs is to create that carrot on a stick for yourself. Here's what I do and, while this may not work for you, I'm hoping that it will inspire you to find your own "rewards."

First, I write out all the things I don't like **ON PAPER WITH BIG LETTERS** about my current job. For example, my list consists of something like this:

* No room for growth. I'm stuck in a position where I'm very good at what I do, but I'm constantly bored because I'm not excited about my job anymore.
* My boss now takes me for granted and expects that I'll work much harder and much later than anyone else in the office. I don't mind working harder or longer, but it's now getting to the point where it interferes with the rest of my priorities and talking to him about it did not help.
* I enjoy where I am (marketing/consulting) but I want to move to a field that I think I would enjoy more (strategy/management consulting).

Sweet, I have that list now, right? What do I do with it? Well, this list is all negatives. Now you need positives. Make a list of all the things you want your new job to have. Here's mine:

* Culture. Culture, culture, culture. I want to be friends with the people I work with. I want a company/job that has a great culture and recruits awesome people (not workers, there's a difference).
*  I want to have an impact. I want to feel happy about the work that I do, and not the paycheck that I get because I made someone a lot of money.
* I want my job to be a part of who I am, not something that defines me. In other words, when someone says "what do you do," a common opener in DC, I want to answer with enthusiasm because I *want* to tell you what I do and not "I'm a PM at so and so firm."
* My dream job would _________________

Sweet. Got that. Now, when you're applying to jobs, here's what you do. Read the negatives. Take a few sips of water. Stand up. Read the positives. Shout "Woo!" or whatever you want. Sit down, get started. Every time you feel your brain give up, repeat the process. You want to tell your brain that this is important and that there is a reward for this. 

*I know the above paragraph sounds a little trite but let me explain why I do this exactly the way I do. First, I read the negatives. That gets me pumped up. I think, "yeah, I'm tired of being used" or "yeah, I love my boss as a friend but he's just not a good boss" or whatever it is that you dislike about your present situation." I then take a drink of water. Taking a drink of water, for me, serves as an intermediary to the positives. I'm metaphorically washing away the negative thoughts so I don't dwell on them (this will hurt your ability to apply to jobs). Now that I'm pumped up, but not focused on what I don't like, I move to the positives. Now I'm really getting myself going - "Hell yeah, there are a lot of cool things out there and I'm going to find one I want to do!" Now I stand up, this gets my blood flowing a bit and continues to build that excitement for what's about to come. I shout something to pump myself up (Let's GO!!!) and then I get to it.*

Finally, any and I mean **ANY** time you finish a job application, stop. Take a break. You did it. Feel good about yourself. Smile. I don't care if you don't feel like smiling. Smile anyway. Go look in a mirror. Tell yourself **ALOUD** that you did it. If you have a roommate, tell them. Call your Mom, your girlfriend, your sibling, your best friend, whoever you can call and tell who won't think you're weird for doing so.

It's all about positive reinforcement and remember you can do it. Good luck with your applications and a new job!

As a side note: You will have to do this at least once an hour or two from my experience. That makes sense because taking a 3-5 minute break every hour when you're working breaks up the monotony and makes you work better. This sort of does the same thing with an added emphasis on the motivation factor.
