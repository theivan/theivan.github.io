  <h1>On bars and social media</h1>
  <div class="content">
    <p>Google+ was better than Facebook in pretty much every single conceivable way.  It hit big with the tech/geek crowd first.  We loved it, and when it came out of beta, we brought our friends over.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s the thing: a social network is only as good as the people on it.  People are used to Facebook.  It&#8217;s what they know, and it&#8217;s been dominant for a long time now.  Longer than Myspace was.  They were invested in Facebook.  Getting them to change completely was tough and nearly impossible at the time.  This is my long explanation/metaphor.</p>

<p>Think of social network sites like a bar.  Everyone hangs out at the same bar.  It&#8217;s not the greatest bar, but it&#8217;s where you&#8217;ve been hanging out for years.  It&#8217;s comfortable. You know everyone there, you&#8217;re familiar with it, and everyone&#8217;s familiar with you.  You&#8217;ve got your favorite spot.  It&#8217;s that place that when people say &#8220;Let&#8217;s go to the bar&#8221;, you don&#8217;t have to ask which bar&#8230;it&#8217;s just The Bar.  </p>

<p>So you hear about this other place, The New Bar.  You decide to check it out, and it&#8217;s freakin&#8217; awesome.  They have clean, comfortable seats, a shiny new floor, awesome beers on tap, great lighting, the works.  It&#8217;s the bar you&#8217;ve always wanted, better than The Old Bar in every way.   You&#8217;re so excited to tell your friends about The New Bar, and you&#8217;re 100% certain that they&#8217;re going to love it like you do, and they&#8217;ll all want to switch bars.  So you go running to your friends to tell them all about it.  And a few of your friends agree to go with you to check it out, and sure enough they love it.  They show up a few times and think it&#8217;s great, and tell their friends.  </p>

<p>But after a while?  They start to go back to the Old Bar.  They don&#8217;t want to switch bars.  They know The Bar.  People know them there.  The bartender might be an asshole, but he&#8217;s <em>their</em> asshole.  The New Bar&#8217;s bartender is a nice guy with a flashy smile, but he doesn&#8217;t make their drinks the way they are used to.  And while a lot of people came to The New Bar, not everyone did.  And they know that at the Old Bar, they&#8217;re going to see all of their friends, and know everyone.  It may not be nearly as good as the New Bar, but it&#8217;s comfortable and change is hard.   After a while, the New Bar loses its customers, and starts making changes, desperate to gain a new clientele, but really just end up shooting themselves in the foot.  In the meantime, the Old Bar makes a few rules changes that the customers grumble and bitch about, but it&#8217;s not enough to make them change.</p>

<p>Thing is, Myspace drove people out.  Facebook didn&#8217;t win out because it was a better service, it won because Myspace kept changing and changing, trying to meet everyone&#8217;s needs until it met no one&#8217;s needs.  People flocked to Facebook because it sucked less, not because it was better.  No matter how much better Google+ was, Facebook wasn&#8217;t BAD enough to make people change their comfortable ways.  In desperation, Google+ made more and more changes, and now it&#8217;s an ugly clusterbomb that I really have no desire to use.  Funny thing is, I think Facebook has made enough changes, and forced so many security holes and advertisements, that I think if G+ had been released in its original iteration now,  it might stand a chance. However, Facebook was at its peak when G+ tried to fight it.  They got one major boost when Facebook introduced a new security screwup that made people panic, but it didn&#8217;t last.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s a shame.  I really was one of Google+&#8217;s biggest fans.  I absolutely loved it.  It was everything I&#8217;d ever wanted in a social network.</p>

  <h1>Understanding books and their context</h1>
  <div class="content">
    <p>Honestly, if your goal is to get a lot out of so-called canonical literature then one pretty straightforward step to take is to understand the historical context of the book.  Don Quixote is funny by itself, but takes on much more philosophical significance when you understand how smart a satire it was of knights-errant stories.  Another example of this: I honestly don&#8217;t understand how anyone can make it 20 pages through The Divine Comedy without understanding that Europe was crawling put of The Dark Ages, which required a really uneasy fusion between Christian culture (the only sinew holding an otherwise fractured Europe together) and the oftentimes contradictory culture of classical antiquity.  Learning a little about the society for whom the work was written adds many dimensions of detail that are sometimes necessary just to understand the book, let alone enjoy it.</p>

<p>Second, don&#8217;t be intimidated.  Great books have withstood the test of time, not because they&#8217;re stodgy and possess the dignity of being an old thing, but because they continue to be dramatic and alive despite their age.  Great books connect us to the past by demonstrating that certain kinds of human concerns are timeless.</p>

<p>Third, the simplest answer is: just look for patterns.  Your brain is designed to find them, so you&#8217;ll be surprised how easy it is if you just relax and have fun with it.  Yes, you&#8217;ll find patterns that the author never intended, but that&#8217;s okay.  That&#8217;s actually great!  A book isn&#8217;t a code you&#8217;re supposed to figure out, it&#8217;s a device that helps you think and feel things.  Use it however you want, it&#8217;s yours, after all.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve read a pretty good chunk of the canon and I don&#8217;t hate popular literature, if anything I like it more because I think it&#8217;s amazing that we live in a society in which so much art is produced, even if some of it is bad and a lot of it is just okay.  It&#8217;s unprecedented in history that so many people would have the time and education to express themselves at all.  I wouldn&#8217;t trust a food critic who was incapable of admitting that, while The French Laundry is better, In-N-Out Burger is also pretty god dammed delicious.</p>

<p>Analyzing literature doesn&#8217;t just enhance the great works, or even just literature.  All storytelling is better when you really take the time to think about all it&#8217;s moving parts.  Again, just look for patterns.  In Game of Thrones, to give one popular example, what might the author be trying to suggest about the people in his world by associating many of them with animals (their crests, nicknames, etc.)?  Maybe that this is a brutal world, red in tooth and claw.  Did the author do this on purpose?  In this case, in my view, probably, but if not who cares?  I just added to my experience of the story by crystallizing that pattern in my mind.</p>

<p>A couple final words of caution.  Don&#8217;t fall into the trap of thinking that you&#8217;re entitled to your opinion.  I mean, of course you are, but 99% of the time when I didn&#8217;t enjoy a work that was considered great the first time I read it it was because I hadn&#8217;t understood yet what others saw in it.  The great books that speak to you right away, that feel like the author is reaching out to you personally over the decades and centuries to exquisitely verbalize something you never even knew had been on the tip of your tongue your whole life, are of incalculable value, but in some ways the ones that make you work for it are even better.  It can be tedious, frustrating, and it can sometimes even feel pointless, but then, on page 270, something clicks, and the result is that you&#8217;ve just learned to see the world in a way that had never even occurred to you before.  And suddenly it isn&#8217;t you that&#8217;s gotten richer, it&#8217;s everything else which is even more complex and manifold than before.</p>

  <h1>Why you should read</h1>
  <div class="content">
    <p>The universe is huge. Time is impossibly vast. Trillions of creatures crawl and swim and fly through our planet. Billions of people live, billions came before us, and billions will come after. We cannot count, cannot even properly imagine, the number of perspectives and variety of experiences offered by existence.</p>

<p>We sip all of this richness through the very narrowest of straws: one lifetime, one consciousness, one perspective, one set of experiences. Of all the universe has, has had, and will have to offer, we can know only the tiniest fraction. We are alone and minuscule and our lives are over in a blink.</p>

<p>All of this strikes me as terribly sad, and if I believed Someone were in charge, I could muster an argument that our awareness of vastness makes our tininess unfair.</p>

<p>But here&#8217;s the thing. Literature lets us experience life through a second consciousness. For a time we share the perspective and experience of the author and his imagination. Our experience of the universe is broadened, multiplied.</p>

<p>Without literature, we are all limited to our own lives. With it, we can know something of what it is to be other people, to walk in their shoes, to see the world their way.</p>

<p>Reading needs no further defense than this, I would say. It is our species&#8217;s most advanced and successful technology for cheating dismal fate out of the abstract aloneness it would otherwise impose on us.</p>

  <h1>How to write</h1>
  <div class="content">
    <p>I can&#8217;t say it better than <a href="http://writerunderground.com/2011/04/28/ira-glass-on-creativity-or-the-gap-between-our-taste-and-our-work/">Ira Glass</a>.</p>

<p>You need to write.  That&#8217;s the only thing that will make your writing better.  You&#8217;re afraid to write something that&#8217;s shit, that dishonors.  But even Hemingway said, &#8220;The first draft of anything is shit.&#8221;  It&#8217;s just a starting point.  You have to get something down in the rough before you can perfect it.    </p>

<p>Stories about your ancestors are what you should write.  They engage your feelings because they mean something to you.  You need to be emotionally engaged in your story.  If you write about things that you don&#8217;t <em>feel</em> about, you won&#8217;t care about the material, and it will be gray, flat, and lifeless.</p>

<p>So start.  Once you get your first draft, go back through and polish.  Do it until you&#8217;re happy with it.  Walt Whitman, the famous poet, started writing <em>Leaves of Grass</em> at 37, and kept rewriting it to perfect it until he died at the age of 72.  You don&#8217;t have to publish it.  You can keep it secret, and polish it until it shines with its own light.</p>

<p>But you have to get it on paper first.  Here&#8217;s what will happen:  You will write, and a lot of it will be shit, and you will worry that you&#8217;ll get run over a bus and someone will find it and know what a hack you are.  But you ignore that inner perfectionist, because it&#8217;ll keep you rewriting the first paragraph until it&#8217;s perfect and you&#8217;ll never get anywhere.  You keep going until its done.  You write the whole thing.  And then, when you&#8217;re finished, you read it.  </p>

<p>You won&#8217;t be happy with it.  You&#8217;ll cringe over the awkward sentences, the poor transitions, the pacing.  But you&#8217;ll find these moments of beauty captured in words, like poetry, alive and breathing.  And you&#8217;ll move back a paragraph and build to that moment, and then the page will come alive, and you&#8217;ll feel the rhythm of the words and how their energy leads into the next moment.  And you&#8217;ll struggle with the turn of a phrase that&#8217;s not just right until, with a twist here and a tweak there, you realize you&#8217;ve captured one of life&#8217;s secrets on the page, and you&#8217;ll glory in it.  You keep going like that.  And every time you do, you&#8217;ll feel your ancestors smile.  </p>

<p>This is the way it&#8217;s done.  This is the way that it&#8217;s <em>always</em> been done.</p>

  <h1>The Cookie Jar</h1>
  <div class="content">
    <h2 id="disclaimer-this-is-not-a-real-conspiracy">Disclaimer: This is not a real conspiracy.</h2>

<p>In the late 19th century, the first sewing machines were just becoming commercially available - in particular, in 1885, the Singer Manufacturing Company began producing the Singer Model 27/127, which utilized the &#8220;vibrating shuttle&#8221; technology (these machines are now highly regarded in the sewing community as the &#8220;Model T&#8221; of sewing machines.)</p>

<p>Naturally, this caused a major shift in the sewing community. Nobody was sewing by hand anymore. It was the beginning of a new era of sewing, one which combined man and machine.</p>

<p>Now, most of the sewing being done at the time (which still holds true today) was done by sweatshops. Tons and tons of sweatshops all over creation, paying barely any money to their workers as they slaved to sew clothing to be sold to the masses. Did these workers have enough food for anything? Hell no. They collected their nickels and dimes at the end of the day and took to the streets at night, begging for anything they could get. After all, they needed food, too. I mean, they could barely afford a loaf of bread, and that wouldn&#8217;t satisfy their hunger. What would they be able to afford with such little money, that would keep them satisfied until their next payday?</p>

<p>Cookies.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s right, cookies that come in those crummy little tins. So you&#8217;ve got a ton of sweatshop workers, being paid jack for sewing things together with their machines, constantly living in fear and poverty while they chow down on cookies like squirrels with acorns in order to keep themselves from fucking dying right then and there.</p>

<p>Eventually, after however many weeks of slaving over piecing clothes together and eating nothing but cookies, those tins pile up. It&#8217;s not like they&#8217;re going to get rid of the tins, they didn&#8217;t really have much else and could at least use those tins for&#8230;I don&#8217;t know, using the lids to play frisbee or something, give it to their kids as a toy?</p>

<p>So you&#8217;ve got these sweatshop workers, with STACKS of cookie tins, who are now using sewing machines. But what about hand-sewing? PFFFFFT, that&#8217;s a thing of the past. Nobody does that in a sweatshop anymore! Why would they, when they&#8217;ve got these highly efficient machines?</p>

<p>But what about their hand-sewing needles? What about all of the things they USED to use? Going to waste. Just sitting there, next to their cookie tins, doing absolutely nothing.</p>

<p>Around this time, mobs were becoming more abundant in America and crime was flooding the streets, with criminals doing whatever they can to make a buck, finding gullible, vulnerable, impoverished folk to help them however they can.</p>

<p>And that&#8217;s where the conspiracy happens.</p>

<p>There was a market out in the streets for hand-sewing needles and products - your every day citizen couldn&#8217;t possibly afford a sewing machine. After all, they were expensive. But their wives LOVED sewing, and there was absolutely no competition for the manufacturers of hand-sewing products.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s where the mob came in. My research suggests the Irish Mob was one of the first groups to utilize sweatshops as a means of racketeering and making a profit. Gangsters and mobsters would break into sweatshops and threaten their workers. Telling them they&#8217;ll give them &#8220;protection&#8221; and &#8220;keep them fed and alive&#8221; if they give the mobsters the hand-sewing needles they don&#8217;t use. Reluctantly, of course, the sweatshop workers would comply, in fear of having their kneecaps obliterated. </p>

<p>And so, the business commenced. The mobsters, having no vessel in which to transport the hand-sewing needles to the black market, just grabbed all the cookie tins the sweatshop workers had left over. Hand-sewing products for dirt-cheap became a HUGE hit on the black market. Nobody went to a store to buy sewing products anymore - they just went out on the street and looked for a guy with a trenchcoat. For a FRACTION of what they were paying before, they could have it all - in the guise of a cookie tin. Genius. Cunning. Masterful.</p>

<p>It absolutely changed the world of hand-sewing forever.</p>

<p>Think of EVERY SINGLE SWEATSHOP IN THE COUNTRY being extorted for their needles. EVERY single one. There was a gargantuan amount of cookie tins with needles in them being transported across the sea and shipped to Europe, Asia, Italy, you name it. Soon, it was widespread all over the world. Not a single sewing company in America was able to compete with the mob&#8217;s prices. And what did this all lead to?</p>

<p><em>The Great Depression.</em></p>

<p>There you have it. This isn&#8217;t just a cute little coincidence. This isn&#8217;t just something funny you happen upon one day browsing Reddit only to keep clicking around to find another funny post. No, this isn&#8217;t just a one-time chuckle-worthy reddit post.</p>

<p><em>This goes deeper than we thought.</em></p>
