        <title>Minimum income</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Yes. By replacing government transfer payments with a minimum income, you could eliminate the welfare trap, reduce overhead costs (less bureaucracy), eliminate poverty, and free people to live their lives as they see fit.

&lt;p&gt;As things stand now, it seems like people in developed nations have converged to the opinion that no one should starve in the streets and kids should have at least some basic level of opportunity. The much more interesting question is what we should do about it.

&lt;p&gt;In the United States at the Federal level they have converged to providing &lt;em&gt;in kind&lt;/em&gt; benefits through various bureaucracies - think housing assistance, medical benefits, and food stamps. These programs have certain means tested requirements so that only people in need end up using these programs. The problem is not that these bureaucracies end up being inefficient and bloated. Rather, the bigger problem is that various overlapping federal programs all have different thresholds for help. In one program you might lose 50 cents of benefits for each additional dollar you make. Multiplied across four programs, and each additional dollar of income would make you &lt;em&gt;worse off&lt;/em&gt;. Even worse, some programs might have big drop offs so that after a certain income threshold, you go from receiving a decent amount of assistance to none at all. These effects lead to incentive structures such that people are &lt;em&gt;afraid to earn more money - afraid to work more&lt;/em&gt;. 

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, establishing a minimum income would free people to live how they want to. By providing unconditional assistance and letting people choose how they want to allocate their spending, people can choose to go back to school, take time off work to learn a new skill, or even start a new business. I don't know how many Einsteins or Larry Pages are out there waiting tables just trying to keep their heads above water, but I'd be willing to bet that there are a lot. Once you create a minimum income, you create an environment that rewards risk taking. &lt;b&gt;For the first time in human history the worst case scenario when starting a new business or going back to school is not starvation&lt;/b&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;There will be people that choose to waste their lives away by living off that income. But there are already lots of people wasting their lives away living off of welfare right now. And even worse, &lt;b&gt;there are already people who are wasting their lives living off of welfare or waiting tables that are too scared to take a risk and make a better future for themselves, their families, and the world&lt;/b&gt;. I don't care who you are. When faced with the choice of the welfare trap where your family will be worse off if you earn more income, you will choose to earn less income, reducing your long-term chances at success in life and depriving the world of your full potential. &lt;b&gt;When it's a choice between your dignity and food in your kids' mouths, you will choose the food.&lt;/b&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have an incredible opportunity in modern society to facilitate the full blossoming of human potential. For the first time in history, we have the opportunity to ensure that everyone gets a chance in life. With the incredible abundance that we have, we can promise that each person will be able to live in dignity. Maybe not in comfort, but at least in dignity. In my opinion, it is the antidote to inequality in capitalist society and the answer to the question to Rawls' question of how we should ensure that everyone benefits from economic growth and technological progress. In an era of increasingly fast change, we need a minimum income now more than ever. It just so happens that we now have the tools to make it a reality.</description>
